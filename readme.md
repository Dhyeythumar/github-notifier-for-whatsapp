GitHub User Activities & Repo Releases Notifier for WhatsApp 
</h1>

<h4 align="center">
Follow GitHub Users to get notified on their public activities & Watch GitHub Repos to get notified on public releases
</h4>

> Note:
>
> -   Check out the status of the services [**here**](https://github-notifier.statuspage.io/). And do subscribe to stay in the loop with new incidences such as critical system failure or scheduled maintenance as they would be reported over there.
> -   Check out the project's [**changelog**](./changelog.md) to know more on how the project is progressing.
> -   Only 1v1 conversations are possible with this WhatsApp bot because **following any particular GitHub User** or **watching any particular GitHub repo** is a personal choice. So by having this bot on a Whatapp group conversation doesn't make any sense. But still, if WhatsApp users want to add this bot to WhatsApp groups then you can open a **Discussion** in this repo. And will decide what to do based on the votes.

## Future Development

> This section contains the list of features that are scheduled for future release & the list of completed features

-   [x] Add **Watch, Unwatch, Watching** feature on GitHub Repos so WhatsApp users can stay updated (notified) whenever there is a new release in a watched repo. [Version 2.0.0](https://github.com/dhyeythumar/github-notifier-for-whatsapp/blob/main/changelog.md#version-200-major-changes)
-   [x] Setup the status page so the bot users can be notified for every incident (failure/maintenance) with the services. [Version 2.2.0](https://github.com/dhyeythumar/github-notifier-for-whatsapp/blob/main/changelog.md#version-220)
-   [x] Add Redis for caching the commands to save the system/service from any abuse & saving any redundant requests to the database. [Version 2.3.0](https://github.com/dhyeythumar/github-notifier-for-whatsapp/blob/main/changelog.md#version-230)
-   [x] Take actions when messages/commands went unread (due to offline/sleep-mode of service ðŸ˜´) so users do not have to resend the messages/commands. [Version 2.4.0](https://github.com/dhyeythumar/github-notifier-for-whatsapp/blob/main/changelog.md#version-240)
